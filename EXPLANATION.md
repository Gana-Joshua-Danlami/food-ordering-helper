# 🛒 FOOD ORDERING SYSTEM – STEP-BY-STEP EXPLANATION  

✅ Clear verbal breakdown of each function  
✅ No code—just explanations  
✅ Easy to understand for beginners  

---

## **1️⃣ `get_user_choice()` – Asking the User to Pick a Food Item**  

📌 **What it does:**  
This function asks the user to enter a number (`1-4`) to select a food item from the menu.  
- If the user picks `4`, the function **returns `None`** (which means they chose to exit).  
- If the user enters an **invalid number or text**, it will **keep asking** until they enter a correct choice.  

📌 **How it works:**  
1. The user is asked to enter a number (`1-4`).  
2. If they enter a **valid number (1, 2, or 3)**, the function returns that number.  
3. If they enter `4`, the function **returns `None`** (which stops the ordering process).  
4. If they enter **anything invalid (like letters or wrong numbers)**, it tells them and asks again.  

📌 **Example:**  
👤 *User inputs:* `2` → ✅ Returns `2` (Burger is selected)  
👤 *User inputs:* `invalid` → ❌ `"Invalid input, try again."` (Keeps asking)  
👤 *User inputs:* `4` → ✅ Returns `None` (User exits the menu)

## **2️⃣ `get_quantity()` – Asking the User for Quantity**  

📌 **What it does:**  
- This function asks **how many units of the food item** the user wants to order.  
- It only accepts **positive numbers (1 or more)**.  
- If the user enters `0` or a negative number, it tells them and **keeps asking** until they enter a valid quantity.  

📌 **How it works:**  
1. The user is asked to enter a quantity.  
2. If they enter **a valid positive number**, it is returned.  
3. If they enter `0` or a negative number, the function says, `"Quantity must be greater than 0"` and asks again.  
4. If they enter **letters or symbols**, the function says, `"Invalid input"` and asks again.  

📌 **Example:**  
👤 *User inputs:* `3` → ✅ Returns `3` (Order confirmed)  
👤 *User inputs:* `-1` → ❌ `"Quantity must be greater than 0."` (Asks again)  
👤 *User inputs:* `invalid` → ❌ `"Invalid input, try again."` (Asks again)

## **3️⃣ `get_item_name(choice)` – Converting the User’s Choice into a Food Name**  

📌 **What it does:**  
- This function **takes the user’s choice (1, 2, or 3) and returns the food name.**  
- It looks up a **dictionary** where:  
  - `1` = `"Pizza"`  
  - `2` = `"Burger"`  
  - `3` = `"Noodles"`  
- If somehow the choice is invalid, it returns `"Unknown Item"` (but this shouldn't happen in normal usage).  

📌 **Example:**  
🔢 *Input:* `1` → ✅ Returns `"Pizza"`  
🔢 *Input:* `2` → ✅ Returns `"Burger"`  
🔢 *Input:* `99` → ❌ Returns `"Unknown Item"` (Shouldn’t happen if `get_user_choice()` is used)

## **4️⃣ `get_item_price(choice)` – Getting the Price of the Food Item**  

📌 **What it does:**  
- This function **takes the user’s choice (1, 2, or 3) and returns the price** of that item.  
- It looks up a **dictionary** where:  
  - `1` = `6500` (Pizza)  
  - `2` = `3000` (Burger)  
  - `3` = `1300` (Noodles)  
- If the choice isn't in the dictionary, it returns `0` (but this shouldn’t happen in normal use).  

📌 **Example:**  
🔢 *Input:* `1` → ✅ Returns `6500` (Pizza price)  
🔢 *Input:* `2` → ✅ Returns `3000` (Burger price)  
🔢 *Input:* `99` → ❌ Returns `0` (Shouldn’t happen if `get_user_choice()` is used)  

---

## **5️⃣ `calculate_total_price(item_price, quantity)` – Calculating the Total Cost**  

📌 **What it does:**  
- This function **multiplies the price of the selected item by the quantity** to get the total cost.  

📌 **Example:**  
🔢 *Input:* `6500, 2` → ✅ Returns `13000`  
🔢 *Input:* `3000, 5` → ✅ Returns `15000`

## **6️⃣ `place_order()` – Managing the Whole Order Process**  

📌 **What it does:**  
- This function **handles the entire ordering process**.  
- The user selects **multiple items** and adds them to a **cart dictionary**.  
- When they finish ordering, the cart is **returned**.  

📌 **Example Output:**  
🛒 `{ "Pizza": {"quantity": 2, "total_price": 13000}, "Burger": {"quantity": 1, "total_price": 3000} }`  

---

## **7️⃣ `check_out(cart)` – Printing the Receipt**  

📌 **What it does:**  
- This function takes the **cart dictionary** and prints a **receipt**.  
- It shows each item, quantity, and total cost.  
- It also **calculates the grand total** and displays a thank-you message.  

📌 **Example Output:**
Checking out... Your order details: Pizza: Quantity - 2, Total Price - 13000 Burger: Quantity - 1, Total Price - 3000 Total Order Price: 16000 Thank you for ordering!

## **8️⃣ `food_ordering_app()` – Running the Whole Program**  

📌 **What it does:**  
- This is the **main function** that starts the entire ordering process.  
- It calls `place_order()` to take orders and `check_out(cart)` to print the receipt.  

📌 **How it works:**  
1. It prints `"Welcome to the Food Ordering App!"`  
2. Calls `place_order()` to get user orders.  
3. Calls `check_out(cart)` to display the final order summary.
