# food-ordering-helper
Structured helper functions for the AltSchool Africa Tinyuka 2024 first semester food ordering project. This guide is based on my experience debugging and refining my own code, making it easier for others to structure their projects correctly!


 Use the functions inside your instructor’s notebook.  
3️⃣ Modify them as needed and add your own features.  
4️⃣ Need help understanding how the functions work? Check out **[EXPLANATION.md](EXPLANATION.md)** for a full breakdown.
