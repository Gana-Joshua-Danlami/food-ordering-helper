# 🛒 Food Ordering Helper (AltSchool Africa Tinyuka 2024 1st semester Project)  

## **🚀 Why I Created This Helper Guide**  
When I started this project, I faced a lot of **unexpected errors**. From invalid inputs to handling user choices, I spent hours **debugging, testing, and refining my functions**.  

At first, it was frustrating, but over time, I realized that **every bug I fixed made me a better problem solver.** I actually had **fun breaking and fixing my own code!**  

So instead of keeping all that experience to myself, I decided to **create this structured guide** to help others **avoid the same struggles.**  

This is NOT a shortcut but a **blueprint** to help you **think through your solutions, structure your code properly, and build something unique.**
